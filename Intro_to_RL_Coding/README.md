# Introduction to RL Coding Exercises

For those with strong math/stats background but need coding practice!

## Philosophy

You understand the theory - now let's build the coding skills. These exercises focus purely on **implementation**, not theory.

## Structure

### Level 1: Array Operations for RL (Start Here!)
- Tracking values in arrays
- Calculating averages incrementally
- Finding maximum values
- Random selection

### Level 2: Basic RL Building Blocks
- Reward tracking
- Action selection logic
- Epsilon-greedy implementation
- Value estimation

### Level 3: Combining Concepts
- Simple environments
- Agent-environment loops
- Policy evaluation
- Performance tracking

## How to Use

1. Start with Level 1 - even if it seems basic, it builds muscle memory
2. Each problem has:
   - Clear objective
   - Starter code
   - Test cases
   - Hints (look at bottom of file)
3. Don't peek at hints until you've tried for 10 minutes!
4. Run tests frequently to check your progress

## Prerequisites

- Python basics (if/else, for loops, functions)
- Basic numpy (we'll teach you what you need)
- Understanding of RL concepts (you have this!)

## Tips for Success

1. **Write comments**: Explain what each line does in your own words
2. **Test incrementally**: Don't write everything then test - test each piece
3. **Use print()**: Print intermediate values to understand what's happening
4. **Google is your friend**: "how to find max value in numpy array" is a valid search!

Let's build your coding confidence! 🚀
