# Reinforcement Learning Practice Problems

This repository contains LeetCode-style practice problems that align with concepts from "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Each chapter's problems are designed to help reinforce theoretical concepts through practical coding exercises.

## Getting Started

1. Each chapter contains 3 problems of increasing difficulty:
   - Easy: Basic concept implementation
   - Medium: More complex scenarios
   - Hard: Integration of multiple concepts

2. Problems include:
   - Detailed problem description
   - Learning objectives
   - Starter code with TODOs
   - Test cases
   - Hints and guidance

3. Recommended approach:
   - Read the corresponding chapter in the textbook
   - Start with the easy problem
   - Run tests to verify your implementation
   - Move to harder problems as you gain confidence
