## 🚀 Start Here

### Step 1: Assess Your Level (5 minutes)

Take this quick assessment:

**Python Basics:**
- [ ] Can write functions with loops and list comprehensions?
- [ ] Comfortable with classes and error handling?

**NumPy:**
- [ ] Can do matrix multiplication without loops?
- [ ] Understand broadcasting?

**ML Fundamentals:**
- [ ] Can implement linear regression from scratch?
- [ ] Understand gradient descent?

**PyTorch:**
- [ ] Can write a training loop?
- [ ] Understand tensors and autograd?

**Your Level:**
- Mostly ✅ = **Advanced** → Jump to Week 5-6
- Half ✅ = **Intermediate** → Start at Week 3-4
- Few ✅ = **Beginner** → Start at Week 1

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Path (2 minutes)

**Option A: Small Drills** (Recommended for beginners)
- Focus: Master fundamentals first
- Time: 1-2 hours/day
- Approach: 3-5 small exercises per day

**Option B: Mini-Projects** (Recommended for experienced)
- Focus: Build portfolio pieces
- Time: 3-4 hours/day
- Approach: Complete projects end-to-end

**Option C: Hybrid** (Balanced)
- Focus: Balance practice and application
- Time: 2-3 hours/day
- Approach: Drills + integration projects

---

### Step 3: Set Up Environment (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib torch jupyter

# Verify installation
python -c "import numpy, pandas, matplotlib, torch; print('All good!')"
```

---

### Step 4: Start Your First Exercise (30 minutes)

**If Beginner:**
```bash
# Start with Core Python
python "Leetcode/CMU_MSML_Prep/00_Skill_Exercises/01_Core_Python/exercise_1_normalize.py"
```

**If Intermediate:**
```bash
# Start with NumPy
python "Leetcode/CMU_MSML_Prep/00_Skill_Exercises/02_NumPy/exercise_2_matrix_ops.py"
```

**If Advanced:**
```bash
# Start with Linear Regression
# (Create your own or use existing implementations)
```
