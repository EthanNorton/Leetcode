## 🆘 Need Help Getting Started?

**Check these guides (in order):**
1. **`01_Core_Python/SIMPLE_GUIDE.md`** - ⭐ **START HERE!** Simple step-by-step guide
2. **`01_Core_Python/exercise_1_normalize_SIMPLE.py`** - ⭐ **EASIEST VERSION!** Simplified template with lots of hints
3. **`HOW_TO_SOLVE.md`** - General problem-solving strategies and frameworks
4. **`WALKTHROUGH_EXAMPLE.md`** - Complete detailed example (Normalize function)

**If the regular template seems too complex:**
- Use `exercise_1_normalize_SIMPLE.py` instead
- Follow `SIMPLE_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions
- Each step is broken down with examples and tests

These guides will teach you:
- How to think about problems
- Step-by-step solution approaches
- Common patterns and strategies
- How to debug and test

## 📁 How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Start with Templates
1. Open a template file (e.g., `exercise_1_normalize_template.py`)
2. Read the instructions and requirements
3. Fill in the `TODO` sections
4. Implement the functions from scratch

### Step 2: Test Your Implementation
1. Uncomment the test functions
2. Run: `python exercise_X_template.py`
3. Debug until all tests pass

### Step 3: Compare with Solutions
1. Once you've implemented and tested, look at:
   - `../00_Skill_Exercises/` folder
   - **Side-by-side guides** (e.g., `02_NumPy/SIDE_BY_SIDE_COMPARISON.md`)
   - Compare your approach with the solution
   - Learn from differences

## ✅ Learning Workflow

```
Template → Implement → Test → Compare → Learn
   ↓         ↓          ↓        ↓        ↓
  Start    Code     Debug   Solution  Improve
```

1. **Template**: Start with blank template
2. **Implement**: Write code from scratch
3. **Test**: Run tests to verify
4. **Compare**: Check against solution
5. **Learn**: Understand differences

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't Peek!** Try implementing before looking at solutions
2. **Read Carefully**: Understand requirements and hints
3. **Test Often**: Run tests after each function
4. **Debug Patiently**: Read error messages carefully
5. **Ask Questions**: If stuck, review concepts first
6. **Compare Thoughtfully**: Learn from solution differences
