## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Read the Exercise
- Open the exercise file
- Read the docstring and requirements
- Understand what you need to implement

### Step 2: Implement
- Fill in the `TODO` sections
- Write your code from scratch
- Don't copy-paste!

### Step 3: Test
- Run the file: `python exercise_X.py`
- Check if tests pass
- Debug if needed

### Step 4: Compare
- Look at the solution (if provided)
- Refactor your code
- Write unit tests

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with TODOs:** Each exercise has TODO markers
2. **Test frequently:** Run tests after each function
3. **Read errors:** Python errors are helpful!
4. **Ask questions:** If stuck, review the concept
5. **Refactor:** Clean up code after it works
