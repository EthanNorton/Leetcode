# CMU MSML Preparation - Practice Problems & Overviews

**Purpose:** Organized collection of ML fundamentals with CMU MSML course alignment and research connections.

**Structure:**
- `01_Foundations/` - Core concepts (ReLU, Gradient Descent, Matrix Ops)
- `02_Course_Specific/` - Problems organized by CMU courses
- `03_Practice_Problems/` - Additional practice with solutions
- `04_Research_Alignment/` - Connections to CMU research (Dr. Shah, etc.)

---

## Quick Start Guide

### For Beginners:
1. Start with `01_Foundations/` - Master the basics
2. Work through problems in order
3. Read the CMU overviews to understand course connections

### For CMU Prep:
1. Review `02_Course_Specific/` by course number
2. Focus on courses you'll take first semester
3. Connect problems to research interests in `04_Research_Alignment/`

### For Practice:
1. Use `03_Practice_Problems/` for additional exercises
2. Try problems without looking at solutions first
3. Compare your approach with provided solutions
