# RL-Themed LeetCode Problems

Traditional LeetCode problems but with RL context!

## Why These Problems?

These combine classic coding patterns with RL scenarios. Perfect for:
- Building coding confidence
- Understanding RL data structures
- Interview prep for ML/RL roles

## Problem Categories

### Arrays & Simulation
- State tracking
- Reward calculations
- Episode management

### Dynamic Programming
- Value iteration patterns
- Policy evaluation
- Bellman equations in code

### Optimization
- Action selection
- Parameter tuning
- Constraint satisfaction

## Difficulty Progression

1. **Easy (1-5)**: Basic data structures, simple logic
2. **Medium (6-10)**: Multiple concepts, optimization
3. **Hard (11-15)**: Complex algorithms, edge cases

Start with Easy even if you're experienced - these build RL-specific patterns!
