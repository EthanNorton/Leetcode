# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! I am solving these to get better coding skills and prepare for CMU MSML program.

## 🎓 CMU MSML Preparation

**⭐ NEW!** Comprehensive preparation materials for Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Science in Machine Learning program.

- **[CMU MSML Prep](CMU_MSML_Prep/README.md)** - Complete learning path with:
  - **Templates/** - Practice exercises with blank templates
  - **00_Skill_Exercises/** - Completed solutions for skill-building
  - **01_Foundations/** - Core ML concepts
  - **02_Course_Specific/** - Problems aligned with CMU courses
  - **03_Practice_Problems/** - Additional practice exercises
  - **04_Research_Alignment/** - Connections to CMU research areas

**Quick Start:** Begin with `CMU_MSML_Prep/Templates/01_Core_Python/exercise_1_normalize_SIMPLE.py` for the easiest introduction!
